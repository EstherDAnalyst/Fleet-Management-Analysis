### FLEET MANAGEMENT ANALYSIS

### PROBLEM STATEMENT
Effective fleet management is critical for organizations to ensure operational efficiency, minimize costs, and maximize resource utilization. This project analyzes Fuel Consumption and Fleet Maintenance data to identify inefficiencies, optimize fuel usage, streamline vehicle maintenance, and enhance fleet performance.

### OBJECTIVES
By the end of this project, we aim to:

1. Identify areas to enhance fuel efficiency and reduce waste.

2. Evaluate driver performance based on fuel consumption and maintenance records.

3. Understand vehicle repair frequency and downtime impact.

4. Provide actionable recommendations to optimize fleet operations and reduce costs.

### TACH STACK
- Power Bi

### DASHBOARD






### RESULTS AND FINDINGS

#### Identifying Areas to Enhance Fuel Efficiency and Reduce Waste
- Certain vehicles (e.g., KWL 406 PD) show significant fuel consumption compared to their kilometers driven, suggesting inefficiencies in their operation or potential maintenance issues.
- Projects such as KMD contribute heavily to fuel costs, indicating the need to evaluate route planning and optimize vehicle allocation for such projects.

#### Evaluating Driver Performance Using Performance Metrics

- Driver behavior is a major factor influencing fuel efficiency. Metrics reveal inconsistent fuel economy across different drivers operating similar vehicles, pointing to a need for training on fuel-efficient driving techniques and adherence to optimal speed ranges.

#### Understanding the Frequency of Vehicle Repairs: Monitoring Vehicle Visits

- High repair frequencies for certain vehicles indicate the need for proactive maintenance plans to avoid breakdowns. Vehicles that undergo frequent, prolonged repairs experience reduced availability, affecting operational productivity.


### RECOMMENDATIONS

1. Prioritize fuel efficiency audits for vehicles with high consumption like HILUX and explore whether alternative routes or load optimizations can improve performance also we can develop driver-specific fuel 
   efficiency reports to identify low-performing drivers and provide training tailored to fuel-saving practices and replace vehicles with consistently poor fuel efficiency or reassign them to shorter, less fuel- 
   intensive routes.

2. Conduct a cost-benefit analysis to evaluate whether vehicles like KWL 406 PD should be repaired or replaced and also reassess project-specific factors (e.g., terrain, workload) contributing to the high costs 
   of RKK to determine if they can be mitigated and Flag high-cost outliers in fuel purchases for potential errors, fraud, or inefficiencies.

3. Perform a correlation analysis to validate if vehicles driven more frequently are undergoing adequate maintenance, ensuring prolonged efficiency and also establish a data-driven maintenance scheduling system 
   based on mileage thresholds and fuel consumption patterns to avoid over-maintenance and consider implementing a telematics system to collect real-time data on vehicle usage and maintenance needs, ensuring 
   balanced workloads across the fleet.
